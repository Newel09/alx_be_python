"""
For this task, you are to write a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle. The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width.

Instructions:

1. Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
2. Define two variables in this file:
3. Length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
4.Width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
For simplicity, let’s use length = 10 and width = 5.
Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
Print the calculated area in a format: The area of the rectangle is: [area].

"""

# Defining the variables
length = 10
width = 5

area = length * width

print(f"The area of the rectangle is: {area}")
